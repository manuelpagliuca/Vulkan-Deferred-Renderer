Project developed for the course of "Real-Time Graphics Programming" at the University of Milan, A.Y. 2021/2022, M.Sc. in Computer Science.
The course provided extensive knowledge about real-time computer graphics.

I decided to develop a [*deferred renderer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) by using the Vulkan API to understand the structure of the new graphics API from the Khronos Group.

If you want to look at the working application without downloading the repository, just check the YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/V7PxEpzkY1c).

For more information about the development process and metrics, it is possible to read the paper [here](https://github.com/manuelpagliuca/deferred-render/files/9254304/DEFERRED_RENDERING___RTGP.pdf). You can also check the project from my website at [this](https://www.manuelpagliuca.xyz/project/render/) link.
