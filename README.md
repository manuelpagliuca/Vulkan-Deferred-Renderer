Project developed for the course of Real Time Graphics Programming, @UNIMI for the Master's Degree in Computer Science.
The course provided extensive knowledge about real-time computer graphics.

I decided to develop a [*deferred renderer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) by using the Vulkan API for understanding the structure of the new graphics API from the Khronos Group.

For more information about the development process and metrics, it is possible to read the paper at [this](https://manuelpagliuca.com/files/DEFERRED_RENDERING___RTGP.pdf).
If you want to look at the working application without downloading the repository, just check this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/V7PxEpzkY1c),
